I’m a product leader with both business skills and a solid engineering background.

For 10+ years I’ve been creating b2c and b2b products, including mobile apps, games and SaaS. At the moment I'm CPO at [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com) leading the prodcut departement.

I love minimalism and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

My interpretation is: the visionary is the only true realist because he is deeply concerned with something that doesn't exist yet, but will inexorably come.
