I’m a product leader with pragmatic business skills and a solid engineering background.

For 10+ years I’ve been creating b2c and b2b products, including mobile apps and games, SaaS solutions, tracking frameworks and video streaming platforms.

My specialties:
- implement aggressive data driven strategies to bring back focus and profitability
- transition complex ecosystems to new business models and competitive scenarios
- restructure organizations to cut TTM and operational overhead


I love minimalism and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

He said it right: the visionary is the only true realist because he is concerned with something that doesn't exist yet, but will inexorably come.

At the moment I'm at [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com) leading the b2b and monetization prodcut departement.
