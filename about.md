I'm a product leader with both business skills and a solid engineering background. For more than ten years I've been creating b2c and b2b products like mobile apps/games, SaaS solutions, video streaming platforms and tracking frameworks.

My specialties:
- implement aggressive strategies to bring back focus and proftabilty
- transition complex ecosystems to new business models and scenarios
- restructure organizations to cut TTM and operational overhead

I love minimalism and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

He said it right: the visionary is the only true realist because he is concerned with something that doesn't exist yet, but will inexorably come.

At the moment I'm at [Dailymotion](https://www.dailymotion.com) leading the b2b and monetization prodcut departement.
