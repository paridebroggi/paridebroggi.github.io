I’m a product leader with 10+ years of experience building B2C and B2B products. I love minimalism and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

He said it well: visionaries focus on what doesn’t exist yet but inevitably will, while realists are just concerned with the status quo.
