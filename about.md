Iâ€™m a product leader with 10+ years experience in creating b2c and b2b products (video platforms, mobile apps, games, SaaS services). I love minimalism and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

He defenitely said it right: visionary people are usually concerned with things that don't exist yet, but will inexorably come. Realist people are just concerned with the status quo.
