I'm a product leader with both business skills and a solid engineering background. For more than ten years I've been creating products for both b2c and b2b models including mobile apps/games, SaaS solutions, video streaming platforms and tracking frameworks.

My specialties:
- implement aggressive strategies to bring back focus and proftabilty
- transition complex ecosystems to new scenarios and business models
- restructure organizations to cut TTM and operational inefficiency

I love minimalism and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

He definitely said it right. The visionary is the only true realist because he is concerned with something that doesn't exist yet, but will inexorably come.
