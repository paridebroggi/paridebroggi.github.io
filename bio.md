I graduated in both computer science and philosophy. This background gives me robust technical skills, strong analytical thinking and a creative passion for product design.

As a product manager, I focus on conceiving world-class applications with engaging user experience, innovative technology and performant business models.

As a developer, I enjoy coding and learning new technologies. My specialties are Swift, Javascript and C++, but for my personal projects I use PHP, HTML5 and CSS too.

I love minimalism, [Goldberg Variations](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/bach-les-variations-goldberg-bwv-988/1071951592) and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

He definitely said it right. The visionary is the only true realist because he is deeply concerned with something that doesn't exist yet, but will inexorably come.

Once I coedited a [book](https://www.amazon.fr/géophilosophie-Gilles-Deleuze-esthétiques-politiques-ebook/dp/B01NBF4N3Z/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529388997&sr=8-1&keywords=geophilosophie+gilles+deleuze) on Gilles Deleuze's philosophy.
