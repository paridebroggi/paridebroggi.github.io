I'm a product leader with both business skills and a strong engineering background.
I have 10+ years experience in creating products for both b2c and b2b models including mobile apps/games, SaaS solutions, straming platforms and tracking frameworks.

My specialties:
- implement aggressive strategies to bring back execution focus and proftabilty
- transition complex product ecosystems to new scenarios and business models
- restructure organizations to reduce time to market and operational efficiency

I love minimalism, [Goldberg Variations](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/album/bach-les-variations-goldberg-bwv-988/1071951592) and this quote attributed to [Federico Fellini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini):

> The visionary is the only true realist

He definitely said it right. The visionary is the only true realist because he is deeply concerned with something that doesn't exist yet, but will inexorably come.

Once I coedited a [book](https://www.amazon.fr/géophilosophie-Gilles-Deleuze-esthétiques-politiques-ebook/dp/B01NBF4N3Z/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529388997&sr=8-1&keywords=geophilosophie+gilles+deleuze) on Gilles Deleuze's philosophy.
