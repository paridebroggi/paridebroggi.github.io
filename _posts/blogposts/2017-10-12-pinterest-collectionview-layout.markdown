UICollectionView has become one of the most popular UI elements among iOS developers.What makes it so attractive is the separation between the data and presentation layers, which depends upon a separate object to handle the layout.

![Pinterest collectionView layout]({{site.imagesurl | append: '2017-10-10-pinterest-collectionview-layout.jpg' | absolute_url }})

The layout is then responsible for determining the placement and visual attributes of the views.

You’ve likely used the default flow layout (a layout class provided by UIKit) which consists of a basic grid layout with some customizations.

But you can also implement your own custom layouts to arrange the views any way you like; this is what makes the collection view so flexible and powerful.

In this UICollectionView custom layout tutorial, you’ll create a layout inspired by the popular Pinterest app.
In the process, you’ll learn a lot about custom layouts, how to calculate and cache layout attributes, how to handle dynamically sized cells and much more.
