title:  "Toyota Hybrid: move the start/stop button to the left for easier vehicle shutdown"

Context: A common Toyota Hybrid drawback is realizing the car is still on only after youâ€™ve stepped outside. Because the start/stop button is typically on the right side of the steering wheel, silencing the alert from outside requires awkwardly leaning into the cabin to reach it.

As a Toyota Hybrid driver, I want the start/stop button on the left side of the steering wheel so I can easily reach it from outside the vehicle, improving convenience and ergonomics when turning the car off.
