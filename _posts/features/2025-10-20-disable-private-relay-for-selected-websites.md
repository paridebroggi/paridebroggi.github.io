title:  "Safari custom whitelist to disable Private Relay"
---
As a Safari user, I can maintain a whitelist of websites for which Private Relay is disabled by default.
The whitelist is managed per Safari profile; each profile has its own list. When visiting a whitelisted domain, Private Relay automatically turns off for that site.
