title:  "Zwilling scale: automatic tare with pre-saved dishes weight"
---
As a Zwilling food scale user, I wish I could pre-save the weights of my dishes and bowls so that the scale automatically applies the correct tare without needing me to weigh the empty plate or bowl each time I start cooking.
