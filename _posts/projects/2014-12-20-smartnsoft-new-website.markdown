A modern website is the best way to attract new customers. For this reason at Smart&amp;Soft we decided to turn our old static HTML5 website into a powerfull AngularJS application.

Our designers worked hard on style and animations. As for me, I strived to use AngularJS at its full potential, for achieving a flawless user experience on all devices.

AngularJS is a great framework, despite sometimes it still appears immature. Routing, nesting views and performances should be surely improved: that's why I'm impatiently waiting Google to release the brand new AngularJS 2.0
