Matrices and quaternions can be really annoying. That's why developers love [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.6/index.html){:target="_blank"}, a great mathematics library written for OpenGL applications. GLM is fast and complete, however it is C++ only.

Sometimes, for didactic purposes, I need a set of GLM's basic tools in a C environment. That's why I coded [glmc](https://www.github.com/pbrog/glmc){:target="_blank"}: a minimal library for OpenGL mathematics.

It comes with vectors and matrices basic functions like lookAt, perspective, scaling, rotation, translation, etc.
If you're familiar with OpenGL, you know they can be really useful.

So... Keep calm and draw a teapot!
