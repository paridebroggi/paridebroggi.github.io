Every day I spend hours on Mac terminal. At first it was bash, then I switched to zsh, then again I migrate to [Fish](https://fishshell.com){:target="_blank"} and finally I came back to the beloved zsh.

Terminal is like your home: you want it to be as comfortable as possible. After years of third parties solutions, I made up my mind and I decided to build a minimal zsh prompt that exactly fits my needs. It just displays:

- username initial letter
- host
- path
- lightweight git monitor

That's it, that's all.

Focus is a minimal, blazing fast and git-aware zsh prompt. To start using it just check out the [github repository](https://github.com/pbrog/focus) anc copy the .zshrc file to your home directory.

I usually pair Focus with [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com){:target="_blank"} and [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16){:target="_blank"} Ocean theme (see picture above to have a preview).
