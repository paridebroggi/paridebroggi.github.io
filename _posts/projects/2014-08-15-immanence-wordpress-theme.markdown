What is perfect design? To me it is something barely invisible. A perfect design should disappear behind the content while enhancing its communicative power.

That's why I believe the majority of the WordPress themes out there are just too complicated. Most of them offer more than you can expect: several layouts, big sliders, clumsy dashboard panels, dozens of short codes...

Sometimes what you need is just a clean, elegant design that boosts your content and doesn't require a whole week-end to be set up.

Immanence WordPress theme was designed to be both essential and complete. It is fast, fully responsive and it comes with clear typography, full-screen images and smart animations. It supports widgets and social sharing out of the box (no additional plugin is needed).

Immanence is a truly minimalist WordPress theme that makes your content shine on all displays and devices. It will give you back the beauty of writing and the pleasure of great photography.
