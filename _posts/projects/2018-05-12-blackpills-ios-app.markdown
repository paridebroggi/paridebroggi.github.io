Blackpills is an insurgent digital media studio co-founded by Daniel Marhely ([Deezer](https://www.deezer.com)) and Patrick Holzman ([Canal+](https://www.mycanal.fr)).

[Blackpills](https://www.blackpills.com) mission is to produce and stream original mobile-first content specifically targeted for millennials audience.


As a member of the initial tech team and then VP of Product, I contributed to every aspect of the application: from the mobile architecture to the design iterations and the overall user experience.

Here are some screenshots and previews of the iOS app.

Building from scratch a video streaming application while keeping it smooth and immersive on all devices was a challenging yet amazing journey.
