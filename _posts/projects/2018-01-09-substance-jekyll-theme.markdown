A self-hosted WordPress installation has been for long the best way to keep a personal blog. WordPress is powerful, well tested and hi-customizable.

But sometimes it just overkills. It's been a while I felt the need of something new. A blog engine more focused on content, more minimalist and definitely more developer-oriented.

As I discovered [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} I fell in love with its core idea. So I decided to code my own template for my personal website. This is what lead me to Substance: the Jekyll theme you see here in action.
